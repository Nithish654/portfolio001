            <!-- Project 1: Jukebox -->
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('jukebox')">Jukebox</button>
            <div id="jukebox" class="hidden">
                <p><strong>Jukebox (Java & SQL):</strong> Developed a jukebox application using Java and SQL during the
                    Java
                    Developer course at NIIT. The application allows users to browse, play, and manage playlists. It
                    integrates SQL for song data storage and retrieval. The application also features search
                    functionality,
                    shuffle, repeat, and song ratings. This project enhanced my Java and SQL skills, focusing on
                    database
                    management and user interface design.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Project 2: Attendance App -->
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('attendanceApp')">Attendance App</button>
            <div id="attendanceApp" class="hidden">
                <p><strong>Attendance App (Android Studio):</strong> Built a mobile app for attendance tracking using
                    Android Studio. The app allows teachers to mark attendance, generate reports, and notify students of
                    missing entries. It uses Firebase for real-time data syncing. A dashboard shows attendance trends,
                    and
                    the app is optimized for performance. This project strengthened my mobile app development and
                    Firebase
                    integration skills.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Project 3: Library Management System -->
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('libraryApp')">Library Management System</button>
            <div id="libraryApp" class="hidden">
                <p><strong>Library Management System (Spring Boot & SQL):</strong> Currently developing a Spring
                    Boot-based
                    library management system. This app handles book issuance, returns, and generates reports. The
                    backend
                    uses SQL to manage books and user data, while the frontend is built with a responsive design. The
                    system
                    also features an admin panel for managing users and books. This project enhances my skills in
                    backend
                    development and database management.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Project 4: LoRa-Based Communication for Agriculture -->
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('loraComm')">LoRa-Based Communication for Agriculture</button>
            <div id="loraComm" class="hidden">
                <p><strong>LoRa-Based Communication for Agriculture (Arduino & LoRa Modules):</strong> Developed a
                    LoRa-based communication system to transmit environmental data such as temperature and humidity for
                    agricultural monitoring. The system uses Arduino boards and LoRa modules for long-range data
                    transmission. This solution enables farmers to remotely monitor farm conditions and receive
                    real-time
                    alerts. The project focuses on the integration of IoT for smart agriculture, improving efficiency in
                    farming operations.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Project 5: SOS Helmet -->
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('sosHelmet')">SOS Helmet</button>
            <div id="sosHelmet" class="hidden">
                <p><strong>SOS Helmet (Arduino & GSM):</strong> Designed an SOS helmet that sends an emergency SMS to a
                    predefined list of contacts when an accident occurs. The helmet is equipped with a sensor that
                    detects
                    impact or sudden movements, triggering the SMS alert. It uses an Arduino board and GSM module to
                    send
                    messages with the exact location. This project aims to improve safety for riders, providing
                    real-time
                    alerts to friends or family members in case of an accident.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Project 6: SPR-Based D-Shaped Dual-Core RI Sensor -->
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('sprSensor')">SPR-Based D-Shaped Dual-Core RI Sensor</button>
            <div id="sprSensor" class="hidden">
                <p><strong>SPR-Based D-Shaped Dual-Core RI Sensor:</strong> Currently working on developing an SPR-based
                    D-shaped dual-core refractive index (RI) sensor. The sensor is designed to measure changes in
                    refractive
                    index using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology. This project involves optimizing the sensor
                    for
                    high sensitivity and accuracy. It will be applied in fields such as bio-detection and environmental
                    monitoring. The focus is on improving sensor performance for real-time applications in the medical
                    and
                    industrial sectors.</p>
